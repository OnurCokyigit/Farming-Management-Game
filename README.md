## How to Play 

* The main aim of the game is to finish the game by completing 25 missions.
* There are 3 different mission types in the game (PLANT, HARVEST, SELL) and the details of the missions are on the main screen.
* Once in every 5 missions and when enough money is provided, the UPGRADE button becomes active and the player can unlock new fields and,increase the size of the warehouse.
* There are 3 products (Wheat, Tomato, Corn) in the mini window that opens when you click on the fields. The planting cost of each product is stated below.
* After the player clicks on a product and plants it, the product grows for a certain period of time, and this period is shown to the player with a green progress bar.
* If the player does not collect the product in the valid time, the product rots and this situation is shown to the player with a red progress bar.
* There is an event section on the main screen of the game. Various events occur to the player during randomly determined periods of time (30s-60s) in the game. These events affect the yield and sales price of the products positively or negatively. The player must make a strategy according to these events.
* In other words, the moment when the player harvests the field and sells the products is very important.
* There is a trader button on the main screen of the game. When the trader button is pressed, a new window opens. In this window, the player can sell the products at their current price. He can see how much money he will earn before selling.
* On the main screen of the game, there are bars showing the money and the time you spend in the game. The player can see his money and time here.
* When the Escape button is pressed in the game, the pause menu opens and the sound controls of the game are provided here. In addition, sound control can be made by pressing the Settings button on the menu screen of the game.
